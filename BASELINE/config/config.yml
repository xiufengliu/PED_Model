# Define scenarios to run (add more based on scenario suggestions)
scenarios:
  baseline:
    description: "Reference case with existing loads and minimal local assets."
    # Scenario-specific settings could go here if needed
    output_subdir: "scenario_baseline" # Subdirectory for results

  high_pv:
    description: "Maximized solar PV deployment on available surfaces within the district."
    output_subdir: "scenario_high_pv" # Subdirectory for results

  pv_battery_1:
    description: Combines high PV penetration with significant electrical battery storage. Different battery sizes can be tested.
    output_subdir: "scenario_pv_battery_1" #Quantify the impact of batteries on increasing PV self-consumption, reducing grid dependency (especially peak imports), and potentially enabling peak shaving.

  pv_battery_2:
    description: Combines high PV penetration with significant electrical battery storage. Different battery sizes can be tested.
    output_subdir: "scenario_pv_battery_2" #Quantify the impact of batteries on increasing PV self-consumption, reducing grid dependency (especially peak imports), and potentially enabling peak shaving.
  
  pv_battery_3:
    description: Combines high PV penetration with significant electrical battery storage. Different battery sizes can be tested.
    output_subdir: "scenario_pv_battery_3" #Quantify the impact of batteries on increasing PV self-consumption, reducing grid dependency (especially peak imports), and potentially enabling peak shaving.

  thermal_storage:
    description: Focuses on optimizing the heating system by incorporating thermal storage (e.g., hot water tanks) potentially coupled with heat pumps or optimized district heating interaction.
    output_subdir: "scenario_thermal_storage" #Evaluate flexibility in the heating sector, potential for sector coupling (using renewable electricity for heat), and reducing peak heat demand.

  dsm:
    description: Simulates the impact of demand-side management by shifting flexible electrical or thermal loads (e.g., EV charging, pre-heating/cooling, specific pool/stadium operations) based on local generation or price signals.
    output_subdir: "scenario_dsm" #Assess the value of load flexibility in reducing costs and integrating variable renewables.

  cost_self_1:
    description: "Compares operational strategies for a given asset configuration. cost_opt minimizes total operational monetary costs. self_suff_max modifies the objective to prioritize using local resources, potentially at a slightly higher monetary cost."
    output_subdir: "scenario_cost_self_1" # Understand the trade-off between economic efficiency and energy independence/self-sufficiency

  cost_self_2:
    description: "Compares operational strategies for a given asset configuration. cost_opt minimizes total operational monetary costs. self_suff_max modifies the objective to prioritize using local resources, potentially at a slightly higher monetary cost."
    output_subdir: "scenario_cost_self_2" # Understand the trade-off between economic efficiency and energy independence/self-sufficiency

  future_prices_1:
    description: "Tests a chosen configuration (e.g., pv_battery) against different future energy price assumptions (e.g., higher carbon taxes, different grid tariff structures)."
    output_subdir: "future_prices_1" # Assess the economic robustness of the PED design under uncertain market conditions

  future_prices_2:
    description: "Tests a chosen configuration (e.g., pv_battery) against different future energy price assumptions (e.g., higher carbon taxes, different grid tariff structures)."
    output_subdir: "future_prices_1" # Assess the economic robustness of the PED design under uncertain market conditions

  invest_opt:
    Description: Allows the model to determine the optimal capacities of PV, batteries, thermal storage, etc., by minimizing total system costs (operational + annualized investment) over the project lifetime.
    Purpose: Identify the most cost-effective mix and sizing of technologies from an investment perspective.
