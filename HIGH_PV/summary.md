## Analysis of Results

### 1. Increase in Installed Capacity
The High PV scenario involves a 153.8% increase in installed photovoltaic capacity compared to the Baseline, from 65 kWp to 165 kWp. This increase is realistic considering the available roof area of the building (700 m²) and the power density of modern photovoltaic panels (approximately 235 Wp/m²).

### 2. Energy Production
The increase in installed capacity leads to a 148.5% increase in annual photovoltaic production. The slight decrease in specific yield (-2.1%) is realistic and can be attributed to factors such as:
- Mutual shading of panels when installation density increases
- Use of less optimal roof areas (non-ideal orientation or inclination)
- Possible inverter limitations when managing higher power

The specific yield of approximately 970-990 kWh/kWp/year is realistic for Denmark, where annual solar irradiation is about 1,000-1,100 kWh/m².

### 3. Reduction in Grid Import
Despite the 153.8% increase in installed capacity, the reduction in grid import is only 10.1%. This result is realistic and reflects a common challenge in photovoltaic systems: the temporal mismatch between production and consumption. Specifically:
- Photovoltaic production occurs mainly during the day, while residential consumption also peaks in the evening
- Production is higher in summer, while consumption (especially for heating) is higher in winter
- Without storage systems, excess energy cannot be used during periods of low production

### 4. Electricity Self-Sufficiency
Electricity self-sufficiency increases significantly, from 6.24% to 15.55%, but remains relatively low. This value is realistic for a residential building without energy storage systems. To increase self-sufficiency beyond 20-30%, the following would be necessary:
- Energy storage systems (batteries)
- Active load management (demand response)
- Additional energy efficiency measures

### 5. Economic Aspects
The additional investment of 90,000 EUR leads to annual savings of 6,877.86 EUR, with a payback period of 13.1 years. These values are realistic considering:
- The current cost of photovoltaic systems (approximately 900 EUR/kWp for installations of this size)
- Electricity prices in Denmark (among the highest in Europe)
- The absence of specific incentives in the model

The payback period of 13.1 years is realistic and in line with typical payback periods for photovoltaic systems in Northern Europe. In countries with higher solar irradiation or higher electricity prices, the payback period could be shorter.

### 6. Environmental Impact
The reduction in CO₂ emissions is 5.1% compared to the Baseline. This value is realistic considering that:
- Heat-related emissions (which represent about 50% of total emissions) remain unchanged
- The reduction in grid import is 10.1%
- The Danish energy mix already includes a significant percentage of renewable energy

The emission factor used (approximately 278 kg CO₂/MWh for electricity) is realistic for Denmark, which has a significant percentage of wind energy in its energy mix.

## Feasibility Considerations

The results of the transition from Baseline to High PV are overall realistic, but there are several aspects to consider:

### Technical Aspects
- **Installation feasibility**: Installing 165 kWp on a 700 m² roof is technically feasible, but requires careful design to maximize space utilization
- **Grid connection capacity**: The model assumes that the grid connection can handle potential energy export, which might require verification with the grid operator
- **Architectural integration**: Installing a photovoltaic system of this size could have a visual impact on the building

### Economic Aspects
- **Financing**: The initial investment of 148,500 EUR is significant and might require specific financing mechanisms
- **Incentives**: The model does not consider any incentives or feed-in tariffs that could improve the project's profitability
- **Maintenance costs**: The model does not explicitly include maintenance costs, which could slightly reduce the annual savings

### Regulatory Aspects
- **Permits**: Installing a photovoltaic system of this size requires specific permits
- **Building regulations**: There might be limitations related to building regulations or architectural heritage conservation
- **Grid connection regulations**: Regulations regarding grid connection and self-consumption vary from country to country and could affect the project's feasibility

## Potential Improvements

To further enhance the building's performance, the following could be considered:

1. **Energy storage systems**: Adding batteries could increase self-consumption of the produced photovoltaic energy, improving self-sufficiency and further reducing grid imports

2. **Energy efficiency measures**: Interventions such as thermal insulation, window replacement, or installation of LED lighting systems could reduce overall energy demand

3. **Renewable sources for heating**: Installing heat pumps or solar thermal systems could reduce heat-related emissions, which represent about 50% of total emissions

4. **Smart energy management systems**: Implementing energy management systems could optimize the use of produced photovoltaic energy, for example by shifting consumption to times of higher production

5. **Energy communities**: Sharing produced energy with neighboring buildings could increase the utilization of photovoltaic energy, improving the project's profitability

## Conclusion

The High PV scenario represents a significant improvement over the Baseline in terms of energy production, economic savings, and CO₂ emission reduction. The results are realistic and in line with typical performance of photovoltaic systems in Northern Europe.

Despite the relatively long payback period (13.1 years), the project has a positive net present value and contributes to the building's energy sustainability goals. With the addition of further measures such as storage systems or energy efficiency interventions, performance could be further improved.
