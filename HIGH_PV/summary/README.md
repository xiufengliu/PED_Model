## Key Findings

1. **Energy Production**:
   - 148.5% increase in PV generation (from 64.13 to 159.36 MWh/year)
   - 10.1% reduction in grid import (from 963.28 to 866.11 MWh/year)

2. **Economic Impact**:
   - 4.0% reduction in total energy costs (saving 6,877.86 EUR/year)
   - 13.1 years payback period for the additional investment of 90,000 EUR

3. **Environmental Impact**:
   - 5.1% reduction in total CO2 emissions (from 530.38 to 503.36 tonnes CO2/year)
   - Equivalent to planting 1,081 trees or avoiding 225,167 km of car travel

4. **Self-Sufficiency**:
   - Increase in electricity self-sufficiency from 6.24% to 15.23%
   - 100% self-consumption of PV generation in both scenarios
